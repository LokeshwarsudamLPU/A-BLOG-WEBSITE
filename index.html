                   <p>In today’s digital world, we seem to be surrounded by news. Clickbait, anyone? Yet the pervasive and often intrusive nature
                    of internet news articles belies the fact that many of these sites are behind a paywall, biased, or feature low-quality reporting.
                    Still, online articles are a great starting point for all kinds of learning assignments across the curriculum.
                    That’s why we’ve compiled a list of the best free article websites for students. Many of these sites offer not only high-quality
                    topical articles on every subject, but also ideas for lessons, such as questions, quizzes, and discussion prompts.</p>

                         <p> Working a cross distance, cultures, time zones, through technology and across organizational boundaries. Each type of virtual 
                        team has its own specific challeng.We developed the world’s first virtual teams training more than 25 years ago and can put
                         together a program specific to the challenges of your virtual team, not just a “one size fits all” solution.
                        
                        Common challenges include:
                        Streamlining cooperation – simpler ways of working and effective virtual meetings
                       1. Creating a communication cadence that engages team members when communicating through technology
                       2. Creating trust remotely and balancing trust, empowerment and control.</p>
